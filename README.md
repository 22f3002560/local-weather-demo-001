# Weather Lookup (Open‑Meteo)

## Overview
A minimal single-page app to fetch current temperature and humidity for any city using the Open‑Meteo public APIs (no API key required). Built with Bootstrap 5.

## Setup
- Download index.html and open it in any modern web browser.
- Requires internet access to call Open‑Meteo APIs and load Bootstrap from CDN.
- Optional: host as static site on any web server.

## Usage
- Enter a city name (e.g., “Paris” or “San Francisco”).
- Click “Get Weather”.
- The page will show:
  - Current temperature (°C)
  - Current relative humidity (%)
  - The matched location and observation time

Tip: If the city isn’t found, try including the country or region (e.g., “Springfield, US”).
